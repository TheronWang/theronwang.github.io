This was my first visit to a National Park in the United States,
and Yellowstone National Park was absolutely stunning!
A big thanks to Zander for organizing this trip and making it such a wonderful experience.

We spent 2 and a half days in the Yellow Stone and another two and a half day in Great Denton.
