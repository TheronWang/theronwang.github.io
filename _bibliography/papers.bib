    abstract = "This paper attempts to discover communication patterns automatically within dog vocalizations in a data-driven approach, which breaks the barrier previous approaches that rely on human prior knowledge on limited data. We present a self-supervised approach with HuBERT, enabling the accurate classification of phones, and an adaptive grammar induction method that identifies phone sequence patterns that suggest a preliminary vocabulary within dog vocalizations. Our results show that a subset of this vocabulary has substantial causality relations with certain canine activities, suggesting signs of stable semantics associated with these {``}words{''}.",

  abstract={This paper delves into the pioneering exploration of potential communication patterns within dog vocalizations and transcends traditional linguistic analysis barriers, which heavily relies on human priori knowledge on limited datasets to find sound units in dog vocalization. We present a self-supervised approach with HuBERT, enabling the accurate classification of phoneme labels and the identification of vocal patterns that suggest a rudimentary vocabulary within dog vocalizations. Our findings indicate a significant acoustic consistency in these identified canine vocabulary, covering the entirety of observed dog vocalization sequences. We further develop a web-based dog vocalization labeling system. This system can highlight phoneme n-grams, present in the vocabulary, in the dog audio uploaded by users.},

    abstract = "Dogs communicate intelligently but little is known about the phonetic properties of their vocalization communication. For the first time, this paper presents an iterative algorithm inspired by human phonetic discovery, which is based on minimal pairs that determine phonemes by distinguishing different words in human language, and is able to produce a complete alphabet of distinct canine phoneme-like units. In addition, the algorithm produces a number of canine repeated acoustic units, which may correspond to specific environments and activities of a dog, composed exclusively of the canine phoneme-like units in the alphabet. The framework outlined in this paper is expected to function not only on canines but other animal species."
